# bike_sharing_demand_project
My Project using Regression Module

The Seoul Bike Sharing dataset contains daily records including various features such as Date, Rented Bike Count, Hour, Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dew Point Temperature, Solar Radiation, Rainfall, Snowfall, Seasons, Holiday, and Functioning Day. I will begin by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, check for missing values, and visualize trends and relationships between features and the target variable, Rented Bike Count. Next, I will detect and remove outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve the dataset's quality. To ensure the stability of my models, I will measure multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and remove highly collinear features like Dew Point Temperature. Following this, I will train an initial linear regression model to establish a performance baseline. I will then apply data transformation techniques, specifically PowerTransformer for normalization and RobustScaler for handling remaining outliers, to enhance model performance. Subsequently, I will train and evaluate advanced models such as DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and XGBoost to capture complex patterns in the data. Lastly, I will analyze feature importance using these tree-based models to identify key predictors. This structured approach will enable me to build robust predictive models and derive valuable insights for the bike-sharing service.
